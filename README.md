Skeleton is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.

Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details.

## Getting started

### Install Global Dependencies
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  * node-sass
  * Go language (1.x)

### Install Local Dependencies
  * [Clone the repo](github-mac://openRepo/https://github.com/covrom/Skeleton-Sass) from your terminal
  * cd to project folder
  * run `[sudo] npm install` (first time users)
  * run `node-sass scss/skeleton.scss css/skeleton.css --output-style compressed` (to watch and compile sass files)
  * build executable `go generate && go build .`
  * run `./Skeleton-Sass` (linux) or `./Skeleton-Sass.exe` (windows)
  * open url `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and see index page

### Why it's awesome

Skeleton is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.
- Minified, it's less than a kb
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- ~~No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS~~


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
